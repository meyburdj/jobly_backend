 **Login**: *guest* | **Password**: *password*

##  üßê  Motivation & Challenges

---

> My major motivation with the backend was to learn about test-driven development, coverage, and error handling within a Node environment. TTD was a departure from past projects, but I grew appreciate how it forces the developer write thoughtful code based on initial design. 
>
> This was my first backend project without any ORM. Raw SQL queries were a difficult change and introduced new syntactical bugs, but in the end the control over the raw queries had it's own benifits. 

##  üíª  **Tech Stack** & *Packages*

  **Node.js | Express | SQL | Postgres | Jest**

 *bcrypt | colors | cors | dotenv | jsonschema | jsonwebtoken | morgan | pg*

Here is a high level overview of a few of the features:
- RESTful API built with Node.js and Express
- 95% test coverage for backend data using Jest
- No ORM, raw SQL queries
- Handled authorization and authentication by utilizing middleware with jsonwebtoken and password encryption with BCrypt
- Data validation with JSON Schema
